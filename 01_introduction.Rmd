# Introduction

Sablefish (*Anoplopoma fimbria*) are a commercially valuable species currently managed in British Columbia (BC) as part of the Integrated Fisheries Management Plan (IFMP) and harvested using trap, longline and trawl gear. For the past ten years (`r yr-8` to `r yr+1`),  BC fishermen have landed an average of approximately `r avgTen` metric tons of sablefish annually.  The majority of sablefish in `r yr`  were captured by longline hook gear  (`r LonglineP`\%) and longline trap gear (`r trapP`\%). The majority of sablefish   in  `r yr+1`   were  captured  by  longline trap gear  (`r trapP2`\%) and longline hook gear  (`r LonglineP2`\%). Fisher-log records plotted in a GIS (Geographic Information Systems) show that the commercial harvest of sablefish typically occurs at depths up to 985 fathoms, along the steep-walled slopes off the west coast of Haida Gwaii (formerly Queen Charlotte Islands), in the complex  troughs  of Queen  Charlotte Sound, and in the steep canyons and ridges off the west coast  of  Vancouver  Island. 


Fishery-independent research and assessment surveys for sablefish have been conducted in BC coastal waters since 1988. Survey procedures have evolved over time, but each year, the surveys consisted of fishing sets using trap gear at randomly selected and/or index sites. These surveys are used to obtain catch rate data for assessing stock abundance, gather biological sample records, monitor oceanographic data, and collect tag release and recapture data. Since 2011, the survey design has remained relatively the same; combining a stratified random sampling (StRS) design for sites along BCâ€™s continental shelf and the continuation of standardized index sites at 5 mainland inlets localities which have been fished since 2002.
