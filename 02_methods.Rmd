# Methods

## SURVEY DESIGN

The methodology for `r yr` and `r yr+1` Sablefish research and assessment survey included a stratified random sampling design component, a traditional inlet component, a Rougheye/Blackspotted Rockfish research project and a benthic impacts study. 

Under the stratified random sampling design component, StRS fishing sets were conducted in randomly chosen 2 km x 2 km grid cells, nested within five spatial strata and three depth strata ( Figure \@ref(fig:figure1)).  The random design began on the 2003 survey, with the purpose of distributing tag releases at random, collecting biological samples and developing a catch-rate based index of abundance [@Wyeth2003].  It provided an alternative design to the historic traditional component (1990 to 2010) of the surveys.

Standardized fishing sets under the traditional component of the surveys had specific gear and sampling protocols.  The purpose of the standardized sets were to collect catch rate data in order to index trends in abundance, tag fish and obtain biological samples.  Standardized fishing sets occurred within mainland inlet localities during the `r yr` and `r yr+1` survey.  The geographic boundaries of these localities are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:figure1).

In order to evaluate the impact of fishing gear to the benthic habitat, camera sets were deployed during the 2012 through to 2017 Sablefish research and assessment surveys.  Nuytco autonomous camera systems were attached to traps to capture video and still imaging. In addition, accelerometers were also deployed on many sets to gather orientation and movement data.  During the `r yr` and `r yr+1` survey, only accelerometers were attached to traps.

### STRATIFIED RANDOM SAMPLING SURVEY COMPONENTS

The main component of the `r yr` and `r yr+1` survey employed a stratified random sampling design (StRS).   Grid cells measuring 2 by 2 square kilometers were nested in each of five spatial strata (S~1~ to S~5~) and three depth strata (RD~1~ to RD~3~).   The three depth ranges included 100-250 fathoms, 250-450 fathoms and 450-750 fathoms.  The start locations of the `r yr` survey are shown in (Figure \@ref(fig:figure2)) and listed in detail in Appendix B. The start locations of the `r yr+1` survey are shown in (Figure \@ref(fig:figure3)) and listed in detail in Appendix C.  

Historically, from 2003 through 2005, five grid cells were randomly selected in each spatial-depth stratum.   Then from 2006 through 2010, the number of grid cells randomly selected in each spatial-depth stratum was increased to six. After 2011, the grid cells were randomly chosen based on area and catch numbers (Table \@ref(tab:table1)).  

### TRADITIONAL SURVEY COMPONENTS

The traditional survey component in `r yr` and `r yr+1` included conducting standardized sets with specific bait and gear requirements at four mainland inlet localities.  A list of historic offshore indexing and tagging localities and a timeline marking the notable changes in these traditional components over the survey years is presented in Appendix A.  Sets were conducted in offshore indexing localities from 1988 through to 2010 and offshore tagging localities were conducted at these sites from 1996 through to 2007.  Trap gear was deployed near the center of each of the five localities in order to avoid the steep slopes characteristic of these channels/fjords.

#### Portland Inlet Mainland Inlet Locality

Portland Inlet was the most northerly mainland inlet locality. It is located just north of Prince Rupert and is approximately 40 kilometers long.  As with previous years, five standardized sets were conducted at this site during the `r yr` and `r yr+1` surveys.  The geo-referenced set polylines in Portland Inlet from 2003 to `r yr+1` are plotted in Figure \@ref(fig:figure4).  

#### Gil Island Mainland Inlet Locality

The Gil Island locality is located south west of Kitimat and is situated in the entrance to Douglas Channel. As with previous years, five standardized sets were conducted at the Gil Island locality during the `r yr` and `r yr+1` surveys.  The geo-referenced set polylines in Gil Island from 2003 to `r yr+1` are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:figure4). 

#### Finlayson Channel Mainland Inlet Locality

The Finlayson Channel locality extends north of Milbanke Sound and west of Roderick Island.  As with previous years, five standardized sets were conducted at the Finlayson Channel locality during the `r yr` and `r yr+1` surveys (Table 6).  The geo-referenced set polylines in Finlayson Channel from 2003 to `r yr+1` are plotted in Figure \@ref(fig:figure4).  

#### Dean/Burke Channel Mainland Inlet Locality

Dean Channel extends north east from Fisher Channel on the north side of King Island and west of Bella Coola. Burke Channel is on the south side of King Island and south west of Bella Coola. As with previous years, five standardized sets were conducted at the Dean/Burke Channel locality during the `r yr` and `r yr+1` surveys.  The geo-referenced set polylines in Dean/Burke Channel from 2003 to `r yr+1` are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:figure4). 

## CHARTERED VESSEL

The F/V `r boat` , skippered by `r captain` and Mike Derry, completed a total of `r setcnt` sets between `r dates`, `r yr`.  The F/V `r boat2` , skippered by `r captain2`, completed a total of `r setcnt2` sets between `r dates2`, `r yr+1`.  Table \@ref(tab:table2) lists all the Sablefish research and assessment surveys conducted from 1988 to `r yr+1`.  This table includes a unique identifier (GFBIO Trip) required to reference the data stored in the Fisheries and Oceans Pacific Groundfish database, GFBIO.

## FISHING GEAR

The longline trap gear consisted of a groundline resting on the ocean floor with 25 baited traps attached to beckets at 150 foot intervals along its length and 90 pound anchors at each end.  The traps had a bottom hoop diameter of 54 inches and no escape rings. The trap web was a braided poly with an inner stretched mesh diameter of 2.5 inches. Inside, the tunnels were made of 2 inch green, braidless, knotless, rashell mesh.  The main gear elements are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:figure5).  

Standard bait bags (6 by 12 inches) made of 1/8 inch web with a nylon drawstring and #7 stainless trolling snaps were included with the traps.  The bait methods for each survey component are listed in Table \@ref(tab:table3). 

##DATA COLLECTION DURING GEAR DEPLOYMENT

Gear was deployed on alternate days within the set target depth stratum and soaked between 22 and 26 hours.  A set log paper form was filled out on the deck stern by the science staff recorder who had maximum visibility of the crew setting the 25 traps over the stern rail.  The set log included the time and identity of the first and last buoys.  The beckets and traps were tallied using checked boxes (trap on becket) or Xed boxes (no trap on becket). The TDR and CTD serial numbers were recorded with the associated trap number.

At the same time, a second science recorder in the wheelhouse completed the required fields in the EDAS (Electronic Data Acquisition Systems) bridge log tabular form series with the titles: header, fishing, spatial, gear specs, depths, environment, comments, usability and finish. The header tabular form included the details of the deployment set date, set number, gear and personel.  The fishing tabular form was used to record the start and end positions of each set at the time when the first and last traps were deployed over the stern. The geo-referenced positions were obtained from the Nobeltec Navigation ? software running on the bridge computer, delivered electronically through a NMEA data string. Next, the spatial tab fields were populated automatically with the details of the statistical fishing grounds of the set.  The gear specifications tabular form included static fields applicable to trap gear and bait, and manual entry of the number of traps set.  The depth tabular form recorded depths from the vessels depth sounder at one-minute intervals between the first and last traps being set.  at the end of the set, the average of these depths would be used to calculate the mean setting bottom depth.  The environment tabular form was completed with the manual entry of the water temperature, wind, sea and sky metrics during deployment. The remaining forms provided entry of comments, documentation of set usability and accounting of the total catch at the finish of the set. Details on electronic entry of the bridge log form is available in the GFBio Field User Guide 2018 and [@olsen2010]. 

##CATCH PROCESSING

The charter EDAS Sablefish Trap Catch form was completed during hauling by the science staff recorder positioned at the Marel platform scale and haul computer.  Each becket number, trap number, basket weight, count and basket use code (D = Discarded after weighing (processed as commercial catch), A = Sampled for LSMWO, T = Tagged and released, SD = Sublegal discarded, F= Frames, NA = No Sablefish catch/Trap missing) were recorded. Crew members would alert the recorder about any damage to a trap (i.e. holes) to enter in the EDAS Trap Usability form.  The use of the Sablefish catch in the `r yr` survey for each trap by StRS set is listed in Appendix D. Details on electronic entry of the trap catch form is available in the GFBio Field User Guide 2018 and [@olsen2010]. 

##BIOLOGICAL SAMPLING

Biological sampling were completed for Sablefish, Yelloweye Rockfish and Rougheye/Blackspotted specimens on the EDAS Fish Recording form. Measurements were electronically recorded for fork length (L), body weight (W), sex (S) and maturity level (M). Sagittal otoliths (O) were collected and stored for later age lab determination.  All legal-sized Sablefish (fork length > 55 cm) that were sacrificed for biological samples were dressed, frozen, and landed as commercial catch. 

##SABLEFISH TAGGING

Fish destined to be tagged were transferred from the sorting area to the tagging tank.  Fork length (mm) measurements taken by the science sampler were transported electronically to the EDAS Fish Recording form by the Scantrol measuring board.  Next, the sampler inserted a tag with a unique identifier (UID) on the left side of each fish, 1 cm below and 2-3 cm behind the anterior insertion of the first dorsal fin.  A Mark II Long Tagging gun loaded with Floy FD-94 T-bar anchor tags was used to tag the Sablefish specimens.   Before release, any sampling errors, injuries or damage to the fish were documented on the Fish Recording form.  Tag checks were performed systematically to ensure tag numbers on the data form matched those on the fish specimen.  

##SABLEFISH TAG RECOVERY

Any previously tagged fish that was were brought aboard may have been treated in one of several ways.  First, the tagged fish may have been re-released with a new tag, with the previous tag removed and stored in a vial.  Second, the tagged fish may have been retained for biological sampling if it had a tag from another country, or if it had sustained numerous injuries.  For these specimens, both the tag and otoliths were stored in a vial.  The Department later returns those tags released by foreign agencies.   The vial numbers are scanned into the EDAS Tag Recovery Entry form and the tag numbers are entered later during the tag processing step.  

##OCEANOGRAPHIC SENSOR DATA COLLECTION

A Sea-bird Bird SBE 39 temperature and pressure logger was placed in a protective plastic pipe and was attached to the inside of the middle or end traps on `r counter[1,2]` sets in `r yr` and `r counter2[1,2]` sets in `r yr+1` during gear deployment.    HOBO Pendant G Loggers, model UA-004-64, were also attached inside the same middle or end traps on `r counter[1,3]` sets (`r yr`) and `r counter2[1,3]` sets (`r yr+1`).  A single accelerometer was also placed just forward of the hauler post. These loggers use an internal three-axis accelerometer to measure acceleration in units of g-force (m/s^{2}).  

A Concerto CTD (conductivity, temperature and depth) sensor was placed inside the middle or end traps on `r counter[1,4]` sets in `r yr` and `r counter2[1,4]` sets in `r yr+1`.  Data from the accelerometers, CTD sensors, SBE temperature and pressure loggers were processed after the set was complete using EDAS Upload Sensor Data form. 

##ELECTRONIC MONITORING (EM) VIDEO DATA COLLECTION  

At the time of hauling gear, the vessel's electronic monitoring (EM) system cameras were activated by the hydraulic sensor.  Three standard analog cameras were positioned at optimal viewing angles to record the survey activities.  Two analog cameras were positioned along the mast to record the catch as it was processed at the hopper. A third analog camera was positioned on the side of the wheelhouse to record the traps as they were brought over the rail. The video data from each set was reviewed by the catch recorder and an assistant shortly after the set to provide quality control.
